## Introduction
  The records of selling the products have been listed to keep an eye on sale transactions. These 
transactions were recorded from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. This contains the details 
of the sale such as orders with different products, the price for that product, order quantity, date, 
and address. These transactions contain sale from various cities in the United States of America. 
In this project, I dove into analyzing the sales record from each month focusing only the sales in 
2019. The process of analyzing rows of information will also undergo data cleaning and ensuring 
the data integrity and quality.

## Data Source
  The datasets were downloaded on GitHub, which is a free source of finding datasets to collaborate 
and share insights with other users. I downloaded the datasets containing 12 CSV files which were 
the sales record separated in months. I loaded all 12 CSV files in Jupyter Notebook and did the 
whole project of cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
